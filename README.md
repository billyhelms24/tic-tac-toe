# Tic-Tac-Toe

A tic-tac-toe game built using only HTML/CSS and Vanilla JavaScript. This project uses javascript to generate a gameboard where players take turns making selection. After each selection, the game checks the current board state against a set of possible win scenarios. The game continues in this loop until a winner is determined through a match in the win scenarios. This project was intended to practice DOM-Manipulation as well as logic process and data structures.
